Dendritic distributions of L-type Ca2+ and SK channels in spinal motoneurons: A simulation study
Read me, Figure 2

requirements:
compile first the mod. files.

Run the simulation by running "Auto_Fig2.hoc"
this will create the patch model and insert voltage clamp with 4 stages.

the default setting is with a prepulse of 1000. pulse width = 500.
the panels shows the patch voltage on top, and the other panel shows the Ca inward current.

change the voltage clamp's duration and amplitude to aquire all the panels in Figure 2

Note: the Random variable generator is on, so each simulation will be different.
to turn it off comment the RNG function in the CaDen mod file.
