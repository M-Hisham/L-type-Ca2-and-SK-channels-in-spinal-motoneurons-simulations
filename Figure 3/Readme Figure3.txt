Dendritic distributions of L-type Ca2+ and SK channels in spinal motoneurons: A simulation study
Figure 3

requirements:
compile first the mod. files.

Run the simulation by running "Auto_startWU2.hoc"
this will create the cell model and insert voltage clamp in the soma.

using the functions available, you can create the IV curve once with SK channels blocked , and another time with SK channels unblocked.
superimposing the data on any analsys tool, you can create panels from figure 3

Note: the Random variable generator is on
