The instructions in this file will assist in running the code to replicate figure 3 in the modeling study entitled “Dendritic distributions of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> and SK<sub>L</sub> channels in spinal motoneurons: A simulation study” by Mohamed H. Mousa and Sherif M. Elbasiouny.

# Steps:
1. Compile the .mod files
2. Run the simulation by running "Auto_startWU2.hoc". This will create the cell model and insert voltage clamp at the soma. Using the provided functions, you can generate the IV curve with and without the SK channels blocked, which will replicate figure 3.
